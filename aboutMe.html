      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I have always been a creative person, and it has always been my goal to work with something creative.  At the same time, I have a fondness for structure. The summer of 2014 I took a summer course in programming fundamentals, and found myself dancing in the kitchen when the small systems I built finally worked. For me, programming is the perfect combination of creativity and a strict set of rules to solve a problem - and this is where I do my best work.<br>
      Since then, I have switched corporate graphic design for full time programming. During my time at university I wrote my first ”Hello world!” script - and graduated top of my class. Now I want to be the best programmer I can be, by constantly learning new things and developing my skills. </p>
