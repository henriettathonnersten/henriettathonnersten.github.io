      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I have always been a creative person, and it has always been my goal to work with something creative.  At the same time, I have a fondness for structure. The summer of 2014 I took a summer course in programming fundamentals, and found myself dancing in the kitchen when the small systems I built finally worked. For me, programming is the perfect combination of creativity and a strict set of rules to solve a problem - and this is where I do my best work.<br>
      Since then, I have switched corporate graphic design for full time programming. During my time at university I wrote my first ”Hello world!” script - and graduated top of my class. Now I want to be the best programmer I can be, by constantly learning new things and developing my skills. </p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>QA Consulting - Trainee</h3>
      <p>July – September 2018</p>
      <h4>Agile</h4>
      <p>To me, the focus for Agile methodologies lies with communication. My major takeaway from this weeklong course is the emphasis on the collective effort to produce the backlog, along with properly prioritised and estimated user stories, as each team member takes responsibility of their own tasks, knowledge and efficiency.</p>
      <h4>Databases</h4>
      <p>Creation and maintenance of databases – from ERDs, via table creation to querying, using both SQL and NoSQL.</p>
      <h4>Java</h4>
      <p>This three weeks long course introduced me to test driven development, pair programming and version control systems, as well as taught me how to integrate databases into Java projects.<br>
      The third week was focused on setting up a complete development environment, including Maven, Wildfly, and Postman, and using it to produce RESTful APIs.</p>

      <h2>Final year project</h2>
      <h3>PEAS - a Preparation of Exam papers & Assignment briefs System </h3>
      <p>September 2017 – May 2018</p>
      <p>My final year project is a proof-reading system, that moves the process of proof-reading online and allows the author and proof-reader of a document to log on to a dedicated proof-reading system, instead of sending heavy word editor files that quickly fills up their inboxes.<br>
      PEAS handles documents containing text and images, allows for comments and approvals of separate sections of documents, creates PDFs, and notifies users via email when an update has been made to one of their documents, so they know when to log on and review it.</p>
