      <p>And this is my website. I am a consultant with QAC. Outside of the office, I spend most of my time enjoying some kind of cultural experience. Currently, I listen to a number of podcasts every week; mostly news and interviews, but the odd discussion on pirates and true crime has come up. A good weekend is one spent in museums, at concerts or comedy gigs, doing yoga, and consuming buckets of coffee.</p>
